Overview:

This program utilizes pygame to display an image of my cat and move it. 

Although it will not be fully reflected in the pseudocode due to the extensive trial-and-error that was required to get it working correctly, the image bounces off of the edges in a manner reminiscent of DVD screensavers.



Pseudocode:

import random
import math
import pygame
initialize pygame

create a screen with width 640 and height 480
set the screen caption

create an object for the background called "object" with screen size
fill the background with a color

create an object for an image called "cat"; load the image
convert with alpha
scale down as needed
create two variables called "cat_x" and "cat_y"; set to 0

create an int variable called "randomAngle"; generate an angle between 0 and 360 degrees and conver this to radians
create two variables called "randomAngle_x" and "randomAngle_y"; both of these are set equa to randomAngle

create a pygame clock object

create a boolean variable called "continueMainLoop"
while continueMainLoop is true:
| clock tick
|
| check if the user has quit; if so, set continueMainLoop to false
|
| if cat_x is outside of the screen range, flip randomAngle_x
| if cat_y is outside of the screen range, flip randomAngle_y
|
| update the screen
